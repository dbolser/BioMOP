The rough outline of the idea is to model the Perl internals for the
set of BioPerl modules and load the data into a query-able (Semantic
MediaWiki) database.

For example, we'd like to capture the inheritance hierarchy of the
modules (probably in the MediaWiki category tree), methods and
arguments, as well as usage meta data (using the community aspect of
the wiki).

For package introspection, we're starting with (but not limited to)
Class::MOP.
